# Task

You need to create a product app using this api: [link](https://dummyjson.com/).
Use products api only, you do not need others.

## Home page

First page that you need to work with is Home page. There should be all types of products and horizontal list of them. For example, title "Phones" and below the title list of phone products and so on for every product type.

When you tap on product you should navigate to ProductPage.

## Search Page

Search page is second page in the app where you should implement searching using api requests.

## Product page

And the last one is Product page. Page which contains all information about the product: carousel of images, price, name, description, etc.

And that's it. In every dart class I've written some hints and tips for you.
Don't miss them.

Good luck!
